When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    So you can more easily and ready push or pull your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You can make sure changed versions are meaningful and contain working changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clones are a copy of a repository without modifying the original.
	Forks are a copy of a repository on GitHub without having to make a
		local copy first.
	Branches are extensions of a repository on your local machine that you
		push or pull.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can revert your changes to flip back to it to see where possible bugs or
		mistakes were introduced, or if you lost your progress.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without using Git/Hub you would have to send files back and forth or use
		a different tool such as google drive or dropbox, etc.
	Collaboration with Git/Hub is easier because it can recognize and help you
		resolve errors, and makes collaboration more efficient.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
