What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	When you initialize a repository you create a connection with Git, which stores
	metadata about the files you're working with.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
 What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area allows you to add files one at a time, then bundles them together
	into a single commit. 
	It could help you keep track of incremental changes you make on different files
	without creating a commit for each file seperately.
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	You can compare between the staging area, working directory, and most recent commit
	to track the size of the changes you've made.
	
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
 organized? How would branches help?

	Branches are helpful when you have multiple versions that you want to keep or test
	seperately. Branches allows you to makes changes and test different features without
	changing an earlier master version.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	
	Diagrams will layout your commits/branches so you can see where things break off
	or merge, and where the parent lines are.
